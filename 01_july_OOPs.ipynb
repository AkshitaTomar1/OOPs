    "1. What is the primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming is to organize and structure code in a way that reflects the real-world          entities and their relationships. It promotes the concept of objects, which encapsulate data and behavior, allowing for the      creation of modular and reusable code. OOP provides concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to enhance        code organization, modularity, and maintainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is an object in Python?\n",
    "In Python, an object is an instance of a class. An object encapsulates data and behavior. It is created from a class and represents a specific instance of that class. Objects have attributes (variables) and methods (functions) associated with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is a class in Python?\n",
    "A class in Python is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects of the class will have. You can think of a class as a template or a prototype for creating objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What are attributes and methods in a class?\n",
    "Attributes: Attributes are variables that store data. They represent the characteristics or properties            of an object.\n",
    "Methods: Methods are functions that are associated with an object. They define the behavior of the object and can operate on the object's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is the difference between class variables and instance variables in Python?\n",
    "Class Variables: These are variables that are shared among all instances of a class. They are defined within the class but outside any method. They are often used to store values that are common to all instances.\n",
    "Instance Variables: These are variables that belong to a specific instance of a class. They are defined inside methods and are prefixed with the self keyword. Each instance of the class can have different values for instance variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What is the purpose of the self parameter in Python class methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python class methods, self is a convention (not a keyword) used to represent the instance of the class.It allows methods to access and modify the attributes of the instance on which the method was called.\n",
    "When a method is called on an instance (obj.method()), the instance is automatically passed as the first argument to the method, and by convention, it's named self. This allows you to refer to the instance within the method.\n",
    "Using self helps in distinguishing between instance variables (belonging to the instance) and local variables (local to the method)."
